# Design

We start by defining our user experience and design. In this section we will look at enough basics in design and user experience to make you dangerous. The goal after this section is that you know enough design to create a professional looking minimal viable product, that is not refused by the user because of horrible desgin. The basic steps are:

1. Doing Concept Ideation
2. Creating Low-Fidelity Deliverables
3. Creating High-Fidelity Deliverables
4. Creating Interactive Prototypes
5. Creating a Design System
6. Delivering to Development

## Concept Idiation

Ideation is a creative process for generating new ideas, and it’s done by interdisciplinary groups. The goal is creating new ideas to use in a product after considering the base requirements and any work that’s already under construction. For example, a team undergos a concept ideation session to create a set of MVP features for a new feature in an app.

A large group ideation session using paper, stickies, and a projector.
Many designers do concept ideation on a whiteboard or paper. However, ideation is also done digitally, especially in distributed offices. Concept generation is a team sport and includes non-designers like product owner/managers and front-end developers. Tools that foster collaboration and are easy to use are best for this task.

## Landing Page Basics

Landing pages are an essential component of any well-crafted, effective inbound marketing strategy. They’re like landing pads for the numerous prospects that visit your website. Whether your goal is to generate leads, sell products, or collect data, your landing pages are where the action happens.

Well optimised landing pages allow you to take the prospects that you attract to your website and convert them into leads. Investing the time into creating well-designed and optimised landing pages is critical because they are your means for generating leads for your business.

With the growing challenge of attracting and holding people’s attention online, it’s more important than ever to design your landing pages to trigger instant conversions. Without a landing page, you won’t be able to gather information about the people visiting your website, which will make it very difficult to understand them, market to them, nurture them, determine how fit they are for your product or service, and ultimately convert them into paying customers.

So, to generate as many leads as you can for your business, it’s crucial that your landing pages are planned, designed, executed, and always working correctly. Optimising your landing pages ensures that first-time and repeat visitors will see the information they need to make purchases and eventually become your brand advocates.

This guide will give you the landing page knowledge you need so you can start boosting your site conversions today. Ready to get started?

# Application Setup

# Build the components

It is best to start with the features over starting to build generic page components like the menu bar. If you only want to learn how to apply gatsby skip this section as it is basially creating some React components with TailwindCSS for styling.

## Design the application

Start with a sketch of the application. Start from the minimal mobile version and go up from there.

Identify the boxes / components that are required. Do this either in figma or on the ipad.

## Build the components 

In this section build the components use things like story book for this process. Setup storybook with typescript. Think about the inputs and output of the application and where the data is coming from e.g. GraphQl?.
